If you've been using Node.js for a while, you've definitely run into streams.
 HTTP connections are streams, open files are streams; stdin, stdout, and stderr are all streams as well.
  A 'stream' is node's I/O abstraction - if you feel like you still need to understand them better, you can read more about them here.

Streams make for quite a handy abstraction, and there's a lot you can do with them - as an example, let's take a look at stream.pipe(), the method used to take a readable stream and connect it to a writeable stream. Suppose we want to spawn a node child process and pipe our stdout and stdin to its corresponding stdout and stdin.
